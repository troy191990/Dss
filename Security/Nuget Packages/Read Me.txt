move nuget.exe into the folder with the csproj file that you want to create a nuget package for.

run nuget spec 
this will give you a file with defaults to fill in. 

once defaults have been filled in
then run
nuget pack <your project file name>.csproj -IncludeReferencedProjects
e.g 
the IncludeReferencedProjects includes all local project file references as well

upload .nupkg onto nuget and wait for it to be verified.
